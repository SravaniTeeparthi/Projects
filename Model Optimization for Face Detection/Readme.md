## The main goal of this project is to develop a face detection method that works for multiple scales and differerent aspect ratios. The basic approach is based on generating proposal boxes, processing them through PCA and SVM and optimizing the pipelined model.

### Steps
  1. Generate ground truth on images
  2. Use Image ground truth to generate groudn truth for boxes.
  3. Optimized model performance estimation
  4. Optimize the final model and obtain results from the final classifier
